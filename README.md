# weather radar chart with D3.js

https://wunanqing.github.io/weather-radar-chart/

This chart shows the daily weather of New York City in 2018.

It's about temperature, cloud coverage, UV index and so on. 

This is a work that I learned from https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3

Thanks Amelia that I can have a chance to learn D3.js
